## In this project, we attempt to use NLP to build a predictive model on the verified status of Amazon reviews. 
## The goal is to have the model identify likely fake reviews, which is a prevalent issue among online purchases. 
## We build a logistic regression as base model, and subsequently a Neural Network in attempt to improve the results. 
## We reached 80% accuracy on out of sample data, and evaluated the economic value by rough estimates. 

## See slide deck and jupyter notebooks for detail.
